This repository contains a script that converts LSODE [1] into C code. The aim is to obtain a standalone version, that does not require any external dependencies.

For now, the script builds a C version. The goal is to embed this solver on GPU, so a CUDA version should follow soon. The Makefile is somewhat ugly and will be fixed in the future.

On top of the original ODEPack, we include a copy of libf2c [2] as well as fsplit [3].
